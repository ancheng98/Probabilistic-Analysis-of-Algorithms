## Probabilistic-Analysis-of-Algorithms
Probabilistic Analysis of Algorithms is a graduate course at McGill that introduces modern probabilistic techniques to analyze average behaviour of algorithms and data structures. 
Topics include: random search trees, random graphs, percolation, MCMC, and entropy.

I included several problem sets and personal solutions for me to review at my convenience. Feel free to take a look, attempt some problems, and share any better solutions you may find :)
