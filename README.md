## Probabilistic-Analysis-of-Algorithms
Probabilistic Analysis of Algorithms is a graduate course at McGill that introduces modern probabilistic techniques to analyze average behaviour of algorithms and data structures. I included several problem sets and personal solutions for me to review at my convenience. Feel free to take a look and share any better solutions you may find :)
